Bounce
======

Bounce is a game of table tennis on the web for two players. It is mimicking the classic game of [Pong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) with some extra twists. It is written in [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) starting out with [Mies](https://github.com/swannodette/mies) [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) template. Any resemblance to the actual laws of physics is purely coincidental.

Ideas for further hacking (or a "backlog" as they say)
--------

* instructions on how to play the game (splash screen/menu maybe?)
* increasing ball speed
* stages (winter, space etc.)
* controls for the game parameters
* some djuizy visuals
* an AI for the lonely
